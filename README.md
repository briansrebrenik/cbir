# Spirit Label Content Based Image Retrieval
Using [BiBirra](https://towardsdatascience.com/bibirra-beer-label-recognition-8546c233d6f4) as a reference create a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system that uses SIFT, SURF or an open source alternative to extract the key features from an image and using these key features identifies the closest reference image to a given query image.
The referenceImages folder contains one image for over seven hundred spirits, use these as the image database and feel free to add additional images to increase accuracy.
The queryImages folder contains images run through a bottle detector model, use these images to test the CBIR system.

You will need to upload your project and any code you used to a public GitHub repo complete with a read me that explains how to run your project. Also include in the read me any packages you used and a description about why you used each one.

Once done we ask that you send us the GitHub link to your project for us to review and we will be in touch about setting up an opportunity for you to go over you code with us and demonstrate in the running program how you met the requirements. 

Keep in mind that the assignment is open ended by design to help us get a sense of how you think through problems. That said, should you need clarification on the assignment feel free to contact us.

Good Luck and look forward to seeing your awesome code!# cbir
